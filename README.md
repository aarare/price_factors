# price_factors
I scraped the features like price (thousand TL), area (m2), date, floor_number, age of building, district, room_count and total_floor_number from https://www.hepsiemlak.com/. 
Firstly, I preprocessed the data. After that, I did EDA by using Tableau. 

This repo includes codes of web scraping and preprocessing of the data
